# Pokedexmax
In this project i have made a pokedex which gives the basic info like height , weight , hp , photo ,etc of the searched pokemon.
I have added features like navigation buttons to the top of the screen, to contact section and to a related video.
Moreover i have added a dark light mode toggle button to the website.
Also if the searched pokemon dosent exist an error(pokemon dosen't exist) is displayed.
All this is done using html , css and javascript.
